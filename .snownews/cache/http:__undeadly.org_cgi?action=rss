<title>OpenBSD 4.8-current on a midrange laptop: Dell Studio 15</title>

&lt;p&gt;Ian Darwin (ian@) writes in with a story he did together with Holger Mikolon about their efforts to get OpenBSD running on new hardware.
&lt;p&gt;OpenBSD developers have generally chosen laptops from makers other than Dell, perhaps due to
the fact that you can't usually walk into a computer store to try out OpenBSD support for Dell notebooks:
Dell sells most of their computers online.
Sometimes, though, it makes sense to buy a brand-name computer and expect that not every
peripheral will work on your favorite open-source operating system.
As jcr@ already said on Undeadly when talking about
&lt;a href='http://www.undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20100718211512'&gt; portable systems: &lt;/a&gt;
"If you pick the right system, there will still be plenty of FUN to be had
in adding or improving support for some of the unsupported or under-supported parts."
Note that jcr@ settled on a larger and somewhat different Dell (Alien 17) for one of the laptops in that article.

Great thanks to Brad for donating hardware.
Committed over the TRENDnet TEW-649UB.

ok deraadt@
&lt;/pre&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
With this commit and the &lt;a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=128897633210060" target="_blank"&gt;recent commit&lt;/a&gt; of 
&lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=urtwn" target="_blank"&gt;urtwn(4)&lt;/a&gt;,
OpenBSD -current now has support for all the single-chip 802.11n USB
devices from Realtek.
With the &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=run" target="_blank"&gt;run(4)&lt;/a&gt; 
and &lt;a href="http://www.openbsd.org/cgi-bin/man.cgi?query=otus" target="_blank"&gt;otus(4)&lt;/a&gt; drivers
already in 4.8, OpenBSD supports a large amount of the 802.11n
USB devices available in stores.
One notable exception is the AR9271 chip from Atheros which is not yet
supported, but this is &lt;a href="http://marc.info/?l=openbsd-cvs&amp;m=129235165205856" target="_blank"&gt;being worked on&lt;/a&gt;.

<title>Ports Hackathon 2010</title>
<link>http://undeadly.org/cgi?action=article&amp;sid=20101206081625</link>
<description>&lt;p&gt;A few weeks ago, the annual ports hackathon was held again in Budapest, Hungary. The event, again organized by Robert Nagy, was a great success: much of the work has already been committed to the OpenBSD cvs repositories.
&lt;p&gt;First time visitor Jacob Meuser wrote in with his take on the event: 

&lt;blockquote style="background-color:#e0e0e0;padding: 1px 7px 1px 7px;"&gt;
&lt;a href="images/p2k10/serenade-full.jpg"&gt;&lt;img src="images/p2k10/serenade.jpg" height="240" width="320" alt="A serenade for a medieval damsel" align="right"&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
&lt;p&gt;scene: jakemsr's house, Eugene, Oregon, USA, Oct 22, 2010:
&lt;blockquote style="background-color:#f0f0f0;padding: 1px 7px 1px 7px;"&gt;
"OK.  See you in 8 days."
&lt;br&gt;Door closes.
&lt;br&gt;5 minutes later ..
&lt;br&gt;Door opens.
&lt;br&gt;"What?  Didn't you have a bus to catch?"
&lt;br&gt;"Yeah, missed it."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;That was the scene at my house in Eugene, Oregon, Oct 22, 2010.
Oregon's in the northwestern region of the United States, in case
you were wondering.  The bus I missed was to take me to the train
station downtown, where I was to board a train that would take me
to Portland, where I'd take a lightrail to the airport, where I'd
get on a plane destined for Amsterdam, where I'd meet jasper@ and
get on plane headed to p2k10 in Budapest, Hungary.

&lt;p&gt;Geez, not even out of the neighborhood and I'm already missing
connections.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please read on for the rest of Jacob's story.

<title>[c2k10] Interview with Henning Brauer (henning@)  Part 11</title>

Henning Brauer (henning@) has been an inspiration to me since I started using OpenBSD. On misc@, there are a few individuals that I follow. Nick Holland's (nick@) posts are very educational and informative and I try to read Henning's as well.  His posts are usually to the point, authoritative and often funny. When you meet henning@ in person and get to know him better, you learn that he has a great sense of humour, that is, if it is not evident already on misc@. He also makes the most out of life even when he misses a step. He has the scars and crutches to prove it. Well, what doesn't kill you...
&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;
Read on to learn why I think that he's a great inspiration to me and what correlation there might be between beer and daemons:
